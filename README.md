# This is a fork of Obsidian Typezen Plugin for customization.

Differences from the original plugins are:
- Hidden sidebars become visible only when mouse cursor moves on them.
- Tab list is always visible to make tab switching with keyboard shortcuts easier.
- When focusing on search box, sidebars become visible.
